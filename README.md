# SQL-Employee-Tracker
Bootcamp Challenge 12

## Your Task

For this bootcamp challenge, I created a content management system that uses Inquirer, MySQL, and Node.js. After opening the application in the command line, the user will be presented with choices for what they would like to do such as View All Employees, View All Employees by Manager, View All Roles, and etc. Once the user answers the first question, they will either be presented with follow up questions to help query the database or they will be presented with the information they requested from the database.

Hope you enjoy the application!
